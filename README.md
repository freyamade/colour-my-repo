# colour-my-repo
A plain and simple browser extension that adds a little splash of SHA-based colour to any repo on GitHub

***Still in progress, will be released soon***

## How it Works

When the extension detects that you are on a repo homepage, it will simply grab the `tease-sha` (the message at the top of the file browser showing the latest commit), take the first 6 characters and use those to colour in a box.
Simple!

## How to Install

Currently you can clone the repo, build the JS and load it as a temp extension in your browser.

I'll add it stores if people want but this is such a dumb little idea that I don't know if people will want it so :D
