# colour-my-repo
A plain and simple browser extension that adds a little splash of SHA-based colour to any repo on GitHub

*I just need some icons and stuff and then I can throw this up on the store, but it's basically done right now!*

## How it Works

When the extension detects that you are on a repository homepage, it will grab the latest commit sha from the page, and use that to generate a coloured progress bar in the section to the right (as in the above picture).

## How to Install

Currently you can clone the repo, build the JS and load it as a temp extension in your browser.

I need an extension icon before I can upload it to a store, I think anyway... I'll look into it!
